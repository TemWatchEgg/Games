            <a href="./Tic-Tac-Toe/TicTacToe.html">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> - Play Tic-Tac-Toe with a friend. Click on a dash to turn it into your shape.
        </li>

            <a href="./SNAKE/snake.html">SNAAAAAAAAKE!!!</a> - A classic Snake game. You control the snake (the green squares), trying to eat as many apples (the smaller red squares) as possible. Includes infinite mode for cowards who don't want to run into the edge (like me).
